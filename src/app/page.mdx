# Don't be a <span className='font-mono'>.fit()</span> Data Scientist

We've put togther a list of our learning from over a decade of industry experience. If we were starting out again this is what we would do differently. We've choosen these resources because they have more of a slant towards being useful in industry instead of just therortical {{ className: 'lead' }}

{/* <div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3"> */}
{/* TODO: change link */}
{/* <Button href="/" arrow="right" children="Cheatsheet" /> */}
{/* TODO: change link */}
{/* <Button href="/sdks" variant="outline" children="Explore SDKs" /> */}
{/* </div> */}

  If you find this sort of stuff useful you can get notified about updates for
