    "These book recomendations are not manuals like alot of the stuff you find on Medium. They won't tell you 'how I made this sexy ML model in Python' with no context. They require a small investment of time, but the pay off is that they help to embed the thought process of a data scientist. That doesn't mean they don't have practical examples and aren't relevent to industry. But you should set your expecttations that the point of reading these books is to embed the inution and thought process of a DS.",

<Note>

    If you aren't a DS yet or don't feel comfortable with maths/statistics this
    note is for you. Do you ever get frustrated reading the same paragraph or
    section from a book/paper and still have no idea whats going on? Do you
    often find yourself spending ages trying to understand some algebraic
    equations and after a few hours have passed you have multiple tabs open and
    feel like crap?
    <p>If so this next paragraph is for you{'...'}</p>
    <p>
      STOP READING BOOKS LIKE THAT! Now I'm being slightly facetious but my
      point is true. I've wasted alot of time reading the wrong way. I'm not
      going to tell you how to suck eggs. If you have a system that works for
      you go for it. But my point here is that if you find what I said
      relateable stop trying to understand every little detail of whats
      happening. Focus on the examples in these books and take a second to step
      back and understand what the authour is trying to do. To help with this
      we've highlighted the relevent chapters and why they are useful and in the
      coming weeks we'll flesh out each book in more detail to help you build
      the intuition.

    <p>It is ok to read a chapter and not understand everything. Thats normal!</p>

# Learning From Data

This book is about the foundations of Data Science. It explains: what is data science really about; how to approach modelling a problem; and fundamentals of machine learning theory (Generalisation error, bias variance trade off)

The key chapters to read are:

- Chapter 1: The Learning Problem
- Chapter 2: Training versus Testing
- Chapter 3: Overftting
