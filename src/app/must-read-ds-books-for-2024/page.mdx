      <p>
        If you aren't a DS yet or don't feel comfortable with maths/statistics
        this note is for you. Do you ever get frustrated reading the same
        paragraph or section from a book/paper and still have no idea whats
        going on? Do you often find yourself spending ages trying to understand
        some algebraic equations and after a few hours have passed you have
        multiple tabs open and feel like crap?
      </p>
      <p>If so this next paragraph is for you</p>
      <p>
        STOP READING BOOKS LIKE THAT! Now I'm being slightly facetious but my
        point is true. I've wasted a lot of time reading the wrong way. I'm not
        going to tell you how to suck eggs. If you have a system that works for
        you go for it. But my point here is that if you find what I said
        relatable stop trying to understand every little detail of whats
        happening. Focus on the examples in these books and take a second to
        step back and understand what the author is trying to do. To help with
        this we've highlighted the relevant chapters and why they are useful and
        in the coming weeks we'll flesh out each book in more detail to help you
        build intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is ok to read a chapter and not understand everything. That's normal!

## The Changing world order

The book is about how the world’s reserve currency and subsequently global positioning changes over time, what features effect it the most and how.

An unconventional recommendation here but Ray Dalio walks you through his analysis on how the world powers/reserve currency status changes using a very data driven approach. He uses the scientific method in a way I wish most data scientists would approach their work problems. Less certainty and more inquiry. Ask questions (aka formulate hypothesis), collect data, synthesise results, present to experts (in your case stakeholders) collect feedback and iterate.

The key chapters to read are:

## Probabilistic Machine Learning Kevin P murphy 2022

The machine learning bible
This is the machine learning bible. I don’t think you should read this cover to cover. This is more of a reference book. Use as needed. Honestly, EVERYTHING is here. If you have a solid maths & programming background and you just want to learn the theory of ML then go for this book. It walks you through the maths, intuitions etc. I really can’t emphasise this enough. It contains basically everything about modern machine learning until 2024. Not for the faint of heart. There is a part 2 containing advanced topics. Good luck with that one if you’re interested lol.

Key Chapters: Anything you choose to read

## Practical Guide to Applied Conformal Prediction in Python

Estimating Uncertainty in your models

Conformal Prediction is a relatively new, model agnostic framework that you can use to quantify the uncertainty in your models. The author is very vocal on twitter about its benefits and a lot of big companies, universities, researchers and personally myself have started to use it in practice. Learn and apply it in order to create valid prediction intervals for your stakeholders.

Key Chapters:

- Chapter 2: Overview of Conformal Prediction
- Chapter 3: Fundementals of Conformal Prediction
- Chapter 4: Validity and Efficiency of Conformal Prediction
- Chapter 5: Types of Conformal Predictors

## Causal Inference in Python

Figuring out why something happens, asking what if questions

Correlation isn’t causation, but what happens when it is? This book goes into the science behind causality and how you can use it. This book also has one of the best foundational statistics explanations I've ever come across and really teaches you to be a whizz with regression. I really enjoyed reading it.

## Interpretable Machine Learning

Figure out how your model behaves and estimate what effect your features have on your target

Getting a prediction from a model is easy but figuring out why that model made that prediction is a lot harder. This book goes through the modern approaches to estimating that! This is more of a text that gives you a birds eye perspective. Once you get the gist go to the model packages to actually understand how to use these techniques along with their trade offs
Key Chapters:

- Chapter 3: Interprebility
- Chapter 5: Interpretable Models
- Chapter 6: Model Agnostic Methods
- Chapter 8: Global Model Agnostic Methods
